  <h2>
    Not sure how much to pay?
  </h2>
  <p>
    We want our shows to be affordable for everyone,
    which means different things for different people.
    We require a $2 per-ticket minimum
    for online reservations,
    but you can pay any amount (or nothing at all)
    for a walk-up ticket at the door.
    Here are some reference points to get you started:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Movie tickets often cost $15 or more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our average is close to $25 per ticket.
    </li>
    <li>
      Similar theaters in Denver charge $30-$60 per ticket.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Every penny goes toward the art --
    paying our collaborators,
    covering their childcare,
    renting rehearsal and performance space,
    purchasing materials (set, props, costumes),
    and facilitating arts programs in Colorado prisons.
  </p>
